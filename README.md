# Ola Map

This project is a React JS application that integrates with the Ola Maps API to provide place autocomplete and directions functionalities. The app displays a map using MapLibre and allows users to search for places, see autocomplete suggestions, and get directions to a selected place.

## Features

- **Place Autocomplete**: As you type in the search box, autocomplete suggestions appear based on the input.
- **Map Display**: Displays a map using MapLibre with a custom style.
- **Directions**: Calculates and displays the distance and duration from the user's current location to the selected place.
- **Recenter Button**: A button to recenter the map on the user's current location.
